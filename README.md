A simple gem to organize storing and retrieving configuration files on AWS S3 in a programmatic, automated fashion.

Use cases:

* Automatically synchronizing newest configs during a deploy
* Bootstrapping developers' environments as part of an onboarding process
* Personal dotfiles synchronization between machines

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'deadpull', '~> 0.1', group: :development
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

If you wish to take advantage of the `deadpull` command in your project's directory, install binstubs with

    $ bundle binstubs deadpull

If you wish to use the provided `deadpull` command globally from the command line, install it with `gem`:

    $ gem install deadpull

## Configuration

Configuration uses two keys currently:

* `path` - required. This is composed of a bucket part and then a prefix, e.g. `my-fancy-bucket/a-directory/prefix`. It relates to locations on AWS S3.
* `aws` - optional. This is a hash containing anything [`Aws::S3::Client`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/S3/Client.html) accepts in its initializer. You should set at least `profile` and `region` keys here.

### Configuration file order

Deadpull will first look for a file called `.deadpull.yml`. Then, data from file `.deadpull.local.yml` will be merged into this. The idea is that you use `.deadpull.yml` for your public configuration and commit this file, while the local file contains e.g. secrets and does not get commited.

When using programmatic operation, any hash passed to `Deadpull::Configuration#new` will be merged into the hash resulting from the above operations, effectively giving it highest priority.

### Environment

Environment is decided by either passing it explicitly to commands, or by using `DEADPULL_ENV` or `RAILS_ENV`. If none of the above is provided, it defaults to `development`, following Rails convention.

## CLI usage

Pulling config for 'production' environment to 'tmp' example:

```
$ deadpull -e production tmp
```

Pushing config from 'tmp' to a specific path on S3 for 'staging' environment example:

```
$ deadpull -u -e staging -p my-fancy-bucket/this-project tmp
```

Note that when not given `-u` (or `--upload`), Deadpull defaults to pulling in order to prevent inadvertent damage to your configuration source-of-truth on S3.

Options description (use `-h` locally to get this):

```
Usage: deadpull [options] <path>

Options:
    -u, --upload                     Push to S3 from given path
    -e, --environment [ENVIRONMENT]  Provides environment, superseding DEADPULL_ENV and RAILS_ENV
    -p, --path [PATH]                S3 path to be used for upload or download in form of bucket-name/prefix. Supersedes config.
    -a, --aws [AWS]                  AWS configuration hash in the form of a JSON string. Supersedes config.
    -v, --[no-]verbose               Explicitly print used configuration.

Common options:
    -h, --help                       Show this message
```

## Capistrano

The Capistrano plugin works by downloading files from S3 to a temporary directory on your machine, then uploading them
over SSH to the target server. That way your AWS keys never leave your machine and the configuration files never hit
a network connection unencrypted. They will be present unencrypted on your machine for the duration of the Cap task though.

Add the following to your Capfile:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/deadpull'
```

Options that are configurable in deploy files:

```ruby
set :deadpull_path, 'my-fancy-bucket/some-prefix' # shouldn't be necessary if you have .deadpull.yml in your project
set :deadpull_environment, 'production' # defaults to fetch(:stage) or the fallback flow as described above
set :deadpull_roles, :app # defaults to :app, this you might actually need to set if you do multi-machine deploys
```

The task hooks into after `deploy:updating`, as soon as shared directories are linked, to ensure your config is in place
for e.g. asset rebuilding, services restart etc.

The structure of your prefix is rebuilt on the target machine, so if your path is `my-bucket/prefix`, environment is `staging` and
you uploaded `config/staging.yml`- resulting in a `my-bucket/prefix/staging/config/staging.yml` structure on S3 - then your
file will be uploaded to `config/staging.yml` with respect to release path on the server.

Note that Deadpull is not concerned whether your files are linked or not; if your config includes paths that are linked,
Deadpull will happily write to those, in effect changing the contents of your `shared` directory during every deploy. This
is because Deadpull aims to essentialy replace linked config files - if you can refresh them on every deploy from a
single source of truth, why not?

## Programmatic usage

### `Deadpull::Commands::Push`

The most complete example of local usage would be:

```ruby
configuration = Deadpull::Values::Configuration.concretize({ path: ..., aws: ...})
environment = Deadpull::Values::Environment.concretize('test')

Deadpull::Commands::Push.call('/some/local/path', configuration, environment) #=> true
# or
Deadpull::Commands::Push.call('/some/local/path/file.yml', configuration, environment) #=> true
```

Note that configuration and environment can be ommited if you want to use the defaults found by methods described in the Configuration section above.

### `Deadpull::Commands::Pull`

The most complete example of local usage would be:

```ruby
configuration = Deadpull::Values::Configuration.concretize({ path: ..., aws: ...})
environment = Deadpull::Values::Environment.concretize('test')

Deadpull::Commands::Pull.call('/some/local/path', configuration, environment) #=> true
```

Note that configuration and environment can be ommited if you want to use the defaults found by methods described in the Configuration section above.

Note that `Pull` will raise an `ArgumentError` if it detects that the given `path` is a regular file.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
